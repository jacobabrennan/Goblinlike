## About
You are a goblin. You and your AI powered companions have entered a mountain cave looking for a place to call home, not knowing the dangers that await you. In the depths of the dungeon, a preceedurally generated maze of coridors and rooms hides undead monsters and the treasure you'll need to survive. Every battle and every footstep sends sounds outward, alerting enemies to your presense. Soon they'll find you. Can you save all your companions? Will you recognize when a situation is hopeless, and abandon some of your friends to save the others? When everything goes wrong, remember that you are a goblin! Find a way to survive, and never give up!
